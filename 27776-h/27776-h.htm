<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>Evan Lloyd&#8217;s works consist chiefly of four satires written in
1766 and 1767,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> all of which are now little-known. What little notice
he receives today results from his friendship with John Wilkes
and David Garrick and from one satire, <em>The Methodist</em>, which is usually
included in surveys of anti-Methodist literature.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> For the
most part, his obscurity is deserved. In <em>The Methodist</em>, however,
he participates in a short-lived revolt against the tyranny of Augustan
satire and shows considerable evidence of a talent that might have
created a new style for formal verse satire.</p>

<p>The seventeen-sixties were a difficult period for satire. The
struggle between Crown and Parliament, the new industrial and agricultural
methods, the workers&#8217; demands for higher pay, the new rural
and urban poor, the growth of the Empire, the deteriorating relations
with the American colonies, the increasing influence of the ideas
of the Enlightenment, the popularity of democratic ideas, the Wilkes
controversy, the growth of Methodism, the growth of the novel, the
interest in the gothic and the picturesque and in chinoiserie, sentimentality,
enthusiasm&mdash;all these activities made England a highly
volatile country. Some changes were truly dynamic, others just
fads. But to someone living in the period, who dared to look around
him, the complexity of the present and the uncertainty of the future
must have seemed enormous.</p>

<p>To a satirist, such complexity makes art difficult. Satire usually
deals with every-day realities, to which it applies simple moral
ideals. The Augustan satiric alternative&mdash;returning to older beliefs
in religion, government, philosophy, art&mdash;and the stylistic expression
of such beliefs&mdash;formal verse satire and epistle, mock-poem,
heroic or Hudibrastic couplet, diction of polite conversation, ironic
metaphysical conceits, fantastic fictional situations&mdash;become irrelevant
to the satirist writing when the past seems lost. In his
later works, Pope took Augustan satire about as far as it could go.
<em>The Epilogue to the Satires</em> becomes an epilogue to all Augustan
satire and the conclusion of <em>The New Dunciad</em> declares the death
of its own tradition. There is a sense now that England and the
world have reached the point of no return. The satirist of the
seventeen-sixties who repeats the ideas and styles of Butler, Dryden,
Swift, Gay, and Pope seems not only imitative but out-of-touch with
the world around him.</p>

<p>But such difficulties can provide the impetus for new forms
and for original styles. And in the seventeen-sixties the writers
of formal satire show signs of responding to the challenge. Christopher
Anstey, Charles Churchill, Robert Lloyd, and Evan Lloyd
seem, during this decade, to be developing their considerable facilities
with satiric technique toward the creation of new styles.
Anstey&#8217;s <em>New Bath Guide</em> has a combination of epistolary fiction,
realism, use of naive observers, changing points of view, sweeping
view of the social scene, great range of subjects, rolicking verse
forms, and tone of detached amusement which suggests a satirist
who, while still largely derivative, had the talent to create new
techniques. Churchill and Robert Lloyd are explicit in their wish
to break from Augustan style. Churchill argues that it was &ldquo;a sin
&#8217;gainst Pleasure, to design / A plan, to methodize each thought,
each line / Highly to finish.&rdquo; He claims to write &ldquo;When the mad
fit comes on&rdquo; and praises poetry written &ldquo;Wild without art, and yet
with pleasure wild&rdquo; (<em>Gotham</em> [1764], II, 167-169, 172, 212). His
satire&mdash;with its deliberate, irreverant, &ldquo;Byronic&rdquo; run-on lines,
fanciful digressions, playful indifference to formal structure, impulsively
involuted syntax, long, wandering sentences&mdash;seems to
move, as does Robert Lloyd&#8217;s satire (at a somewhat slower pace),
toward a genuinely new style. In being chatty, fluid, iconoclastic,
spontaneous-sounding, self-revealing, his satire might eventually
prove capable of dealing with the problems that the Augustan satirists
had predicted but did not have to deal with so directly. But
both Churchill and Robert Lloyd died before they could develop
their styles to the point that they had a new, timely statement to
make. Anstey failed to develop beyond the <em>New Bath Guide</em>, and
his influence proved to be more important on the novel than on
verse satire.</p>

<p>Evan Lloyd&#8217;s first satire, <em>The Powers of the Pen</em>, is a clever
but ordinary satire on good and bad writing. It has some historical
interest as an example of the early influence of Rousseau in England,
of part of the attack on Samuel Johnson for his adverse criticism
of Shakespeare, of the influence of Churchill (Lloyd declared
himself a disciple), and of the expression of the fashionable interest
in artlessness which was influenced as much by Joseph Warton
as by Rousseau. In a &ldquo;quill shop&rdquo; the narrator discovers magic
pens which write like various authors. The one whose &ldquo;Mate was
purchas&#8217;d by Rousseau&rdquo; can:</p>

<p class="poem1">
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Teach the Passions how to grow</span><br />
With native Vigour; unconfined<br />
By those vile Shackles, which the Mind<br />
Wears in the <em>School of Art</em>....<br />
Yet will no <em>Heresies</em> admit,<br />
To gratify the <em>Pride of Wit</em> (p. 30).</p>

<p>He advances these critical dicta elsewhere in this satire, condemning
Johnson because he tries &ldquo;Nature&rdquo; by &ldquo;<em>Critic-law</em>&rdquo; (p. 21).
With fashionable Rousseauistic ideas he praises:</p>

<p class="poem1">
The <em>Muse</em>, who never lov&#8217;d the Town,<br />
Ne&#8217;er flaunted in brocaded Gown;<br />
Pleas&#8217;d thro&#8217; the hawthorn&#8217;d Vale to roam,<br />
Or sing her artless Strain at Home,<br />
Bred in plain Nature&#8217;s simple Rules,<br />
Far from the Foppery of Schools (p. 36).</p>

<p>Evan Lloyd, Robert Lloyd, and Churchill, starting from somewhat
different philosophic principles, all arrive at similar positions.</p>

<p><em>The Curate</em>, his second satire, is largely autobiographical.
It shows, as does <em>The Powers of the Pen</em>, some clever turns of
phrases, pithy expressions, and amusing images. It also contains
incisive criticism of corruption in the Church, of declining respect
for Christianity, and, what seems to Lloyd almost the same thing,
of a collapsing class structure. The Church wardens, &ldquo;uncivil and
unbred! / Unlick&#8217;d, untaught, un-all-things&mdash;but unfed!&rdquo; are &ldquo;but
sweepers of the pews, / The <em>Scullions of the Church</em>, they dare
abuse, / And rudely treat their betters&rdquo; (pp. 16-17). They show a
lack of proper respect both for class-structure and Christianity:</p>

<p class="poem1">
<em>Servant to Christ!</em> and what is that to me?<br />
I keep a servant too, as well as He (p. 17).</p>

<p>But <em>The Curate</em> frequently descends to a whine. The curate is
morally above reproach while those above him are arrogant and those
below him are disrespectful.</p>

<p>The most serious problem with <em>The Curate</em>, however, is the
same as the problem with all of Lloyd&#8217;s satires except <em>The Methodist</em>,
and the same as the problem with almost all satires between
Pope and Burns or Blake. The satirist seems unwilling to probe,
to find out what are the political, ethical, psychological, or aesthetic
forces that cause the problems which the satirist condemns,
and to recommend what can be done to change these forces. If the
satirist notes any pattern at all, it is one of ineffective, unmoving
abstraction and generality.</p>

<p>One explanation for this deliberate avoidance of more profound
issues is not hard to find. An astonishing number of satires of
this period contain a large proportion of lines devoted to describing
how wonderful everything is. The widespread conviction that
whatever is, in the England of the late eighteenth century, is right,
may have resulted from the influence of <em>An Essay on Man</em>. Or
the <em>Essay</em> may have been popular because it expressed ideas already
in general acceptance. But whatever the explanation is, the
catch-phrases extracted from Pope&#8217;s most popular work become the
touchstones of post-Augustan satire.</p>

<p>The problem that the satirist faced in the sixties was, then,
formidable. The country was in upheaval but the conventions demanded
that the satirist say everything was nearly perfect. As a
result, satire tended toward personal whines, like <em>The Curate</em>, toward
attacking tiresomely obvious objects, like the superficial chit-chat
of Lloyd&#8217;s <em>Conversation</em>, toward trivial quarrels, like Churchill&#8217;s
<em>Rosciad</em>, toward broadly unimpeachable morals, like Johnson&#8217;s
<em>The Vanity of Human Wishes</em>. It is understandable that many writers,
such as Joseph Warton and Christopher Smart, abandoned satire
for various kinds of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Methodism lent itself to such satire. Methodists could be described
as unfortunate aberrants from an essentially good world,
typical of those bothersome fanatics and deviants at the fringe of
society who keep this world from being perfect. They were also
logical heirs to the satire once visited upon Dissenters but which
diminished when Dissenters became more restrained in their style
of worship. (The Preface to one anti-Methodist satire even takes
pains to exclude &ldquo;rational Dissenters&rdquo; from its target.) Many Methodists
were followers of Calvin. These Methodists brought out the
old antagonisms against the Calvinist doctrine of Election (or the
popular version of it), directed against its severity, its apparent
encouragement of pride, and its antinomian implications. The mass
displays of emotion at Methodist meetings would be distasteful to
many people in most periods and probably were especially so in an
age in which rational behavior was particularly valued. And there
were those people who believed that Methodism, in spite of Wesley&#8217;s
arguments to the contrary, led good members of the Church of England
astray and threatened religious stability.</p>

<p>Yet all these causes do not explain the harshness of anti-Methodist
satire. No other subject during this period received such
severe condemnation. Wesley and Whitefield were accused of seducing
their female converts, of fleecing all their converts of money,
of making trouble solely out of envy or pride. Evan Lloyd is not
so harsh nor so implacably bigoted about any other subject as he
is about Methodism. He was an intimate friend of John Wilkes, the
least bigoted of men. Also, there are essential differences between
the Dissenters of the Restoration and the Methodists of the late
eighteenth century that would seem to lessen the antagonism toward
the Methodists. To the satirists of the Restoration, Dissenters
were reminders of civil war, regicide, the chaos that religious division
could bring. Now the only threat of religious war or major
civil disturbance had come from the Jacobites, and even that threat
was safely in the past. It is notable that Swift, Pope, and Gay
tended to satirize Dissenters within the context of larger problems.
The assault on Methodists, then, is actually not a continuation of
anti-Dissenter satire but something new. Hence the whole movement
of anti-Methodist satire in the sixties and seventies has an
untypically violent tone which cannot be explained solely in terms
of satiric trends or religious attitudes. The explanation lies, I
think, partly in the social, political, and economic background.</p>

<p>The Methodist movement was perhaps the most dramatic symptom
(or at least the symptom hardest to ignore) of the changes taking
place in England. The Methodist open-air services were needed
because new industrial areas had sprung up where there were no
churches, and lay preachers were necessary because of population
shifts but also because of the increase in population made possible
by new agricultural and manufacturing methods. The practice of
taking lay preachers from many social classes had obvious democratic
implications. Wesley, in spite of his political conservatism,
challenged a number of widely-held, complacent aphorisms, such
as the belief that people are &ldquo;poor only because they are
idle.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
The mass emotionalism of the evangelical meetings were reminders
that man was not so rational as certain popular ideas tried to make
him. Wesley&#8217;s insistence (with irritatingly good evidence) that he
did no more than adhere to the true doctrine of the Church of England
strongly suggested that the Church of England had strayed
somewhere. (It is rather interestingly paralleled by Wilkes&#8217;s insistence
that he only wanted to return to the Declaration of Rights,
a reminder that the government had also strayed.) And Methodism,
by its very existence and popularity, posed the question of whether
the Church of England, in its traditional form, was capable of dealing
with problems created by social and economic changes.</p>

<p>These social, economic, and political issues are touched upon
by a number of the anti-Methodist satirists. Most of these satirists,
however, are contented simply to complain about the lower class
tone of the Methodist movement, to note generally, as Dryden and
Swift had noted before, that Protestantism contained the seeds of
mob rule. The anonymous author of <em>The Saints</em> fears &ldquo;Their frantic
pray&#8217;r [is] a mere <em>Decoy</em> for <em>Mob</em>&rdquo; (p. 4) and the
author<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> of <em>The
Methodist and Mimic</em> claims that Whitefield&#8217;s preaching sends &ldquo;the
Brainless Mob a gadding&rdquo; (p. 15). Evan Lloyd is the one anti-Methodist
satirist who explores the larger implications.</p>

<p>Lloyd constructs his satire around the theme of general corruption,
that nothing is so virtuous that it cannot be spoiled either
by man&#8217;s weakness or by time. The theme is common in the period
and could have become banal, except that Lloyd applies it to the
corruption of the Church and its manifestations in daily life, giving
it an immediate, lively reference. The Methodist practice of lay
preachers, for example, Lloyd treats as an instance of the collapse
of the class system:</p>

<p class="poem1">
Each vulgar Trade, each sweaty Brow<br />
Is search&#8217;d....<br />
Hence ev&#8217;ry Blockhead, Knave, and Dunce,<br />
Start into Preachers all at once (p. 29).</p>

<p>Lloyd combines the language of theology, government, and civil
order to suggest a connection between recent riots, the excesses
of the Earl of Bute, the Protestant belief that religious concepts
are easily understood by all social classes, democracy, the emotional
displays of Methodism, and lay preachers:</p>

<p class="poem1">
Hence Ignorance of ev&#8217;ry size,<br />
Of ev&#8217;ry shape Wit can devise,<br />
Altho&#8217; so dull it hardly knows, ...<br />
When it is Day, or when &#8217;tis Night,<br />
Shall yet pretend to keep the Key<br />
Of <em>God</em>&#8217;s dark Secrets, and display<br />
His <em>hidden Mysteries</em>, as free<br />
As if <em>God&#8217;s privy Council</em> He,<br />
Shall to his Presence rush, and dare<br />
To raise a <em>pious Riot</em> there (pp. 29-30).</p>

<p>Lloyd presents an essentially disorderly world in which chaos
spreads almost inevitably, in which riots, corrupt ministers, arrogant
fools, disrespectful lower classes, giddy middle classes, and
lascivious upper classes are barely kept in check by a system of
social class, government, and church. Now, with the checks withdrawn,
lawyers and physicians spread their own disorder even further
as they:</p>

<p class="poem1">
Quit their beloved wrangling <em>Hall</em>,<br />
More loudly in a <em>Church</em> to bawl: ...<br />
And full as fervent, on their Knees,<br />
For <em>Heav&#8217;n</em> they pray, as once for <em>Fees</em>; ...<br />
The <em>Physic-Tribe</em> their Art resign,<br />
And lose the <em>Quack</em> in the <em>Divine</em>; ...<br />
Of a <em>New-birth</em> they prate, and prate<br />
While <em>Midwifry</em> is out of Date (pp. 30-31).</p>

<p>He combines the language of tradesmen with the language of mythology
and theology to suggest, rather wittily and effectively, that
disorder can be commonplace and cosmic simultaneously:</p>

<p class="poem1">
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The</span> <em>Bricklay&#8217;r</em> throws his <em>Trowel</em> by,<br />
And now <em>builds Mansions in the Sky</em>; ...<br />
The <em>Waterman</em> forgets his <em>Wherry</em>,<br />
And opens a <em>celestial Ferry</em>; ...<br />
The <em>Fishermen</em> no longer set<br />
For <em>Fish</em> the Meshes of their Net,<br />
But catch, like <em>Peter</em>, <em>Men of Sin</em>,<br />
For <em>catching</em> is to <em>take them in</em> (pp. 32-34).</p>

<p>This spreading confusion is, however, not just a passing social
problem but one that results from many breasts being &ldquo;tainted&rdquo;
and many hearts &ldquo;infected&rdquo; (p. 34). The corruption is almost universal
and results in Wesley (as he actually did) selling &ldquo;Powders,
Draughts, and Pills.&rdquo; Madan &ldquo;the springs of Health <em>unlocks</em>,/ And
by his Preaching cures the <em>P</em>[<em>ox</em>],&rdquo; (he was Chaplain of Lock Hospital)
and Romaine:</p>

<p class="poem1">
Pulls you by <em>Gravity up-Hill</em>, ...<br />
By your <em>bad Deeds</em> your <em>Faith</em> you shew,<br />
&#8217;Tis but <em>believe</em>, and <em>up You go</em> (p. 36).</p>

<p>Lloyd treats the confusion between sexual desire and religious
fervor as another aspect of general human depravity, extending the
satire beyond the crude accusation of hypocrisy or cynicism. He
argues that the confusion is a part of the human condition, allowed
to go out of control by a religion that puts passion before reason.
The Countess of Huntingdon, &ldquo;cloy&#8217;d with <em>carnal</em> Bliss,&rdquo; longs &ldquo;to
taste how <em>Spirits</em> kiss.&rdquo; In his all-inclusive catalogue of &ldquo;<em>Knaves</em>/
That crawl on <em>Earth</em>&rdquo; Lloyd includes &ldquo;<em>Prudes</em> that crowd to <em>Pews</em>,/
While their <em>Thoughts</em> ramble to the <em>Stews</em>&rdquo; (p. 48).</p>

<p>What makes Lloyd interesting, in spite of his many derivative
ideas and techniques, is inadvertently pointed out by the <em>Critical
Review</em>, which complains that &ldquo;the author outmethodizes even
Methodism itself.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> That the brutal tone of <em>The Methodist</em> went
beyond the license usually permitted the satirists was recognized
by Lloyd himself. At the conclusion of the satire he asks God to
halt the Methodist movement by getting to its source:</p>

<p class="poem1">
Quench the hot flame, O God, that Burns<br />
And <em>Piety</em> to <em>Phrenzy</em> turns!</p>

<p>And then, after a few lines, he applies the same terms to himself:</p>

<p class="poem1">
But soft&mdash;&mdash;my <em>Muse</em>! thy Breath recall&mdash;&mdash;<br />
Turn not <em>Religion</em>&#8217;s Milk to Gall!<br />
Let not thy <em>Zeal</em> within thee nurse<br />
A <em>holy Rage</em>! or <em>pious Curse</em>!<br />
Far other is the <em>heav&#8217;nly Plan</em>,<br />
Which the <em>Redeemer</em> gave to Man (pp. 52-53).</p>

<p>The satirist, as Robert C. Elliott points out, has always, in art,
satirized himself.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> But there is here as throughout this satire, some
attempt to develop a style which will express the belief that the
world will always be disorderly and that the disorder stems from
man&#8217;s &ldquo;Zeal within.&rdquo; This condition of the world can be expressed
satirically by a personal, informal satire which recognizes and
dramatizes just how universal the corruption is and how commonplace
its manifestations have become.</p>

<p>The informal, disorderly syntax, the colloquial diction, the
chatty tone, the run-on lines, the conscious roughness of meter and
rhyme, may have derived from Churchill, but they become here more
relevant than in any of Churchill&#8217;s satires. They combine with the
intemperate tone and the satirist&#8217;s concluding confession, his self-identification
with the object of satire, to create a sense of an unheroic
satirist, one who does not represent a highly commendable
satiric alternative. Satire must now turn its vision from the heroic,
the apocalyptic, the broadly philosophical, even from the depraved,
and become exceedingly ordinary. It must recognize that there is
little hope in going back to lofty Augustan ideals. For such subjects,
it uses the impulsive tone of an over-emotional satirist who
is as flawed as the subject he satirizes and still represents the
best of a disordered world.</p>

<p>Lloyd had attempted an autobiographical satire in <em>The Curate</em>.
He failed to create an important satire for a number of reasons, one
of which was that he tried to present himself as a high ideal, a belief
that he apparently held so weakly that the satire became merely
petulant. Lloyd corrected this error in <em>The Methodist</em> and now seems,
however briefly, to have opened the way to a truly prophetic style
of satire.</p>

<p>After <em>The Methodist</em> Lloyd wrote <em>Conversation</em>, a satire that
not only failed to fulfill the promise of <em>The Methodist</em> but is more
conservative in theme and style than any of his earlier satires.</p>

<p>After that work he produced little. He published an expanded version
of <em>The Power of the Pen</em> and a dull ode printed in <em>The Annual
Register</em>. When William Kenrick, in <em>Love in the Suds</em>, implied that
Garrick was Isaac Bickerstaff&#8217;s lover, Lloyd defended Garrick in
<em>Epistle to David Garrick</em>. Kenrick replied with <em>A Whipping for the
Welch Parson</em>, an ironic Dunciad-Variorum-type editing of Lloyd&#8217;s
<em>Epistle</em>, in which he got much the better of Lloyd. Lloyd was no
match for Kenrick at this sort of thing. Except for these uninteresting
productions and his convivial friendship with Wilkes and
Garrick, we hear not much more of Lloyd.</p>

<p>We know so little about his life that we can only speculate
why he failed to follow up the promise of <em>The Methodist</em>; why, after
favorable reviews from the journals<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and the flattering friendship
of famous men, he was not encouraged to continue a career that
was as promising as the early career of many famous satirists.
The explanation may lie solely in his personality. Perhaps the
moderate success he achieved and the financial rewards it brought
were enough for him.</p>

<p>Another explanation is suggested by the conservative ideas
and style of <em>Conversation</em>, which are more like Pope&#8217;s than are the
ideas and style of any earlier satire of Lloyd&#8217;s. In this satire he
explicitly repudiates his older, freer critical dicta in both theory
and practice:</p>

<p class="poem1">
Tho&#8217; this be <em>Form</em>&mdash;yet bend to <em>Form</em> we must,<br />
Fools <em>with it</em> please, <em>without it</em> Wits disgust (p. 3).</p>

<p>He uses mostly end-stop couplets, parallel constructions, Augustan
diction and similes. Apparently, he began his rejection of his new
ideas and style immediately after <em>The Methodist</em> and before his
1766-1767 outburst of satire-writing was over.</p>

<p>Lloyd, in writing <em>The Methodist</em>, seems to have come as close
as any satirist before Blake and the writers of <em>The Anti-Jacobin</em>
to seeing the problems England and the world were headed toward,
to recognizing how genuinely volatile English society was in the
middle of the century, and to creating a style which could deal with
those problems satirically. It may be that he got some realization
that his own long passages in <em>The Methodist</em> praising this best of
all possible worlds (pp. 16-20) and his invocation to the &ldquo;heav&#8217;nly
Plan&rdquo; at the conclusion made no sense, that they were contradicted
by other passages in the same satire, that England and the world
were changing with enormous rapidity, and that the satirist would
have to create a new style to express the tremendous economic,
political, social, and religious problems that were coming into being.
It may be that getting such a faint notion he withdrew into
artistic conservatism, into conviviality, and into silence.</p>

<p class="poem">
Nothing, search all creation round,<br />
Nothing so <em>firmly good</em> is found,<br />
Whose substance, with such closeness knit,<br />
<em>Corruption</em>&#8217;s <em>Touch</em> will not admit;<br />
But, spite of all incroaching stains,<br />
Its native purity retains:<br />
Whose texture will nor warp, nor fade,<br />
Though moths and weather shou&#8217;d invade,<br />
Which <em>Time</em>&#8217;s sharp tooth cannot corrode,<br />
Proof against <em>Accident</em> and <em>Mode</em>;<br />

And, maugre each assailing dart,<br />
Thrown by the hand of Force, or Art,<br />
Remains (let Fate do what it will)<br />
<em>Simple</em> and <em>uncorrupted</em> still.</p>

<p class="poem">
<em>Virtue</em>, of constitution nice,<br />
Quickly degen&#8217;rates into <em>Vice</em>;<br />
Change but the <em>Person</em>, <em>Place</em>, and <em>Time</em>,<br />
And what was <em>Merit</em> turns to <em>Crime</em>.<br />
<em>Wisdom</em>, which men with so much pain,<br />
With so much weariness attain,<br />
May in a little moment quit,<br />
And abdicate the throne of Wit,<br />
And leave, a vacant seat, the brain,<br />
For Folly to usurp and reign.<br />
Should you but discompose the tide,<br />
On which <em>Ideas</em> wont to ride,<br />
<em>Ferment</em> it with a <em>yeasty Storm</em>,<br />
Or with high <em>Floods of Wine</em> deform;<br />

Altho&#8217; <em>Sir Oracle</em> is he,<br />
Who is as wise, as wise can be,<br />
In one short minute we shall find<br />
The wise man gone, a fool behind.<br />
<em>Courage</em>, that is all nerve and heart,<br />
That dares confront Death&#8217;s brandish&#8217;d dart,<br />
That dares to single Fight defy<br />
The stoutest Hector of the sky,<br />
Whose mettle ne&#8217;er was known to slack,<br />
Nor wou&#8217;d on thunder turn his back;<br />
How small a matter may controul,<br />
And sooth the fury of his soul!<br />
Shou&#8217;d this intrepid Mars, his clay<br />
Dilute with nerve-relaxing Tea,<br />
Thin broths, thin whey, or water-gruel,<br />
He is no longer fierce and cruel,<br />
But mild and gentle as a dove,<br />
The <em>Hero</em>&#8217;s melted down to <em>Love</em>.<br />
The <em>juices</em> soften&#8217;d, (here we note<br />
More on the <em>juices</em> than the <em>Coat</em><br />

Depends, to make a valiant Mars<br />
Rich in the heraldry of scars)<br />
The <em>Man</em> is <em>soften&#8217;d</em> too, and shews<br />
No fondness for a bloody nose.<br />
When <em>Georgy S&mdash;k&mdash;&mdash;le shunn&#8217;d the Fray</em>,<br />
He&#8217;d swill&#8217;d a little too much Tea.<br />
<em>Chastity</em> melts like sun-kiss&#8217;d snow,<br />
When Lust&#8217;s hot wind begins to blow.<br />
Let but that <em>horrid Creature, Man</em>,<br />
Breathe on a lady thro&#8217; her fan,<br />
Her <em>Virtue</em> thaws, and by and bye<br />
Will of the <em>falling Sickness</em> die.<br />
Lo! <em>Beauty</em>, still more transitory,<br />
Fades in the mid-day of its glory!<br />
For <em>Nature</em> in her kindness swore,<br />
That she who kills, shall kill no more;<br />
And in pure mercy does erase<br />
Each killing feature in the face;<br />
Plucks from the cheek the damask rose,<br />
E&#8217;en at the moment that it blows;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Dims the bright lustre of those eyes<br />
To which the Gods wou&#8217;d sacrifice;<br />
Dries the moist lip, and pales its hue,<br />
And brushes off its honied dew;<br />
Flattens the proudly swelling chest,<br />
Furrows the round elastic breast,<br />
And all the Loves that on it play&#8217;d,<br />
Are in a tomb of wrinkles laid;<br />
Recalls those charms, which she design&#8217;d<br />
To <em>please</em>, and not <em>bewitch</em> Mankind;<br />
But with too delicate a touch,<br />
Heightening the <em>Ornaments</em> too much,<br />
She finds her daughters can convert<br />
Blessings to curses, good to hurt,<br />
Proof of parental love to give,<br />
She blots them out that Man may live.</p>

The hour will come (which let not me<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
The hour will come, when <em>Chloe</em>&#8217;s form<br />
Shall with its beauty feed the worm;<br />
That face where troops of Cupids throng,<br />
Whose charms first warm&#8217;d me into song,<br />
Shall wrinkle, wither, and decay,<br />
To Age, and to Disease, a prey!<br />
<em>Chloe</em>, in whom are so combin&#8217;d<br />
The charms of body and of mind,<br />
As might to Earth elicit <em>Jove</em>,<br />
Thinking his Heav&#8217;n well left for Love;<br />
Perfection as she is, the hour<br />
Will come, when she must feel the pow&#8217;r<br />
Of <em>Time</em>, and to his wither&#8217;d arms,<br />
Resign the rifling of her charms!<br />
Must veil her beauties in a cloud,<br />
A grave her bed, her robe a shroud!<br />
When all her glowing, vivid bloom,<br />
Must fade and wither in the tomb!<br />
When she who bears the ensigns now,<br />
Of Beauty&#8217;s Priestess on her brow,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
Shall to th&#8217; abhorr&#8217;d embrace of Death<br />
Give up the sweetness of her breath!<br />
When worms&mdash;but stop, <em>Description</em>, there&mdash;<br />
My heart cannot the picture bear&mdash;<br />
Sickens to think there is a day,<br />
When <em>Chloe</em> will be made a prey<br />
To Death, a piece-meal feast for him<br />
With rav&#8217;nous jaw to tear each limb,<br />
And feature after feature eat,<br />
While <em>Beauty</em> only serves for <em>Meat</em>&mdash;<br />
Wretched to know that this is true,<br />
Forbear t&#8217; anticipate the view!<br />
Hence, <em>Observation</em>!&mdash;take your leave!&mdash;<br />
And kindly, <em>Memory</em>, deceive!<br />
And when some forty years are fled,<br />
And age has on her beauties fed,<br />
Dear <em>Self-Delusion</em>! lend thy skill<br />
To fancy she is <em>Chloe</em> still!</p>

<em>Athens</em>, of arts the native land,<br />
Cou&#8217;d not the stroke of Time withstand;<br />
There Serpents hiss, and ravens croak,<br />
Where <em>Socrates</em> and <em>Plato</em> spoke.</p>

<p class="poem">
Proud <em>Troy</em> herself (as all things must)<br />
Is crumbled into native dust;<br />
Is now a pasture, where the beast<br />
Strays for his vegetable feast,<br />
Old <em>Priam</em>&#8217;s royal palace now<br />
May couch the ox, the ass, the cow.&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
<em>Rome</em>, city of imperial worth,<br />
The mighty mistress of the earth;<br />
<em>Rome</em>, that gave law to all the world,<br />
Is now to blank Destruction hurl&#8217;d!&mdash;<br />
Is now a sepulchre, a tomb,<br />
To tell the stranger, &ldquo;Here was <em>Rome</em>.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
View the <em>West Abbey</em>! there we see<br />
How frail a thing is royalty!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Where crowns and sceptres worms supply,<br />
And kings and queens, like lumber lie.<br />
The <em>Tombs themselves</em> are worn away,<br />
And own the empire of <em>Decay</em>,<br />
Mouldering like the royal dust,<br />
Which to preserve they have in trust.<br />
Nor has the <em>Marble</em> more withstood<br />
The rage of <em>Time</em>, than <em>Flesh and Blood</em>!<br />
The <em>King of Stone</em> is worn away,<br />
As well as is the <em>King of Clay</em>&mdash;<br />
Here lies a <em>King without a Nose</em>,<br />
And there a <em>Prince without his Toes</em>;<br />
Here on her back a <em>Royal Fair</em><br />
Lies, but a little worse for wear;<br />
Those lips, whose touch cou&#8217;d almost turn<br />
Old age to youth, and make it burn;<br />
To which young kings were proud to kneel,<br />
Are kick&#8217;d by every Schoolboy&#8217;s heel;<br />
Struck rudely by the <em>Showman&#8217;s Wand</em>,<br />
And crush&#8217;d by every callous Hand:<br />

Here a <em>puissant Monarch</em> frowns<br />
In menace high to rival Crowns;<br />
He threatens&mdash;but will do no harm&mdash;<br />
Our <em>Monarch</em> has not left an arm.<br />
Thus all <em>Things</em> feel the gen&#8217;ral curse,<br />
<em>That all Things must with Time grow worse</em>.</p>

<p class="poem">
But your Philosophers will say,<br />
<em>Best Things grow worst when they decay</em>.<br />
And many facts they have at hand<br />
To prove it, shou&#8217;d you proofs demand.<br />
As if <em>Corruption</em> shut her jaw,<br />
And scorn&#8217;d to cram her filthy maw,<br />
With aught but dainties rich and rare,<br />
And morsels of the choicest fare;<br />
As garden Birds are led to bite,<br />
Where&#8217;er the fairest fruits invite.<br />

Will breed a <em>Pestilence when dead</em>.<br />
Thus <em>Aldermen</em>, who at each Feast,<br />
Cram Tons of Spices from the East,<br />
Whose leading wish, and only plan,<br />
Is to learn how to <em>pickle Man</em>;<br />
Who more than vie with <em>&AElig;gypt</em>&#8217;s art,<br />
And make themselves a <em>human Tart</em>,<br />
A <em>walking Pastry-Shop</em>, a <em>Gut</em>,<br />
Shambles by Wholesale to inglut;<br />
And gorge each high-concocted Mess<br />
The art of Cookery can dress:<br />
Yet spite of all, when <em>Death</em> thinks fit<br />
To take them off, lest t&#8217; other bit<br />
Shou&#8217;d burst these <em>living Mummies</em>, able<br />
Neither to eat, nor quit the Table;<br />
Whether He Dropsy sends or Gout,<br />
To fetch them by the Shoulders out;<br />

And wipe the tears from Orphans eyes;<br />
Bid her Affliction&#8217;s hour beguile,<br />
And teach the tear-worn Cheek to smile;<br />
Bid her send Comfort to expell<br />
Grief from the lonely Widow&#8217;s Cell;<br />
Make blunt the arrows of Mischance,<br />
And ope the eyes of Ignorance;<br />
To those lost Pilgrims point the Way,<br />
Who in <em>Sin</em>&#8217;s tenfold Darkness stray,<br />
Recall them from <em>Hell</em>&#8217;s thickest night,<br />

So far&#8217;d it with <em>our Saint</em>, while He<br />
Wou&#8217;d seem downright <em>Humility</em>,<br />
Some honest Features cry&#8217;d aloud,<br />
&ldquo;Our Master is of Spirit proud.&rdquo;<br />
Pass him with Bonnet on, his Lip<br />
Will hang as low as to his Hip;<br />
His bloated Eye its Venom darts,<br />
And from its gloomy Socket starts;<br />
And if the <em>Body</em>&#8217;s frame we scan,<br />
He cannot be an <em>upright Man</em>.<br />
And there are Proofs, from which we see<br />
His <em>Body</em> and his <em>Soul</em> agree.<br />
Altho&#8217; he is as fond of <em>Pray&#8217;rs</em>,<br />
As Country Girls of Country Fairs;<br />
Yet shou&#8217;d he in the Church-yard spy<br />
Some <em>tempting Wanton</em> passing by,<br />
E&#8217;en at the Moment that his Knee<br />
Is bent in Sign of <em>Piety</em>,<br />
Quick his <em>Devotion</em> leaves the <em>Heart</em>,<br />
And settles in some <em>other Part</em>;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
The Book of <em>Pray&#8217;r</em> is shut, and <em>Heav&#8217;n</em><br />
For the dear Charms of <em>C&oelig;lia</em> giv&#8217;n.</p>

<p class="poem">
Th&#8217; <em>Arch-Fiend</em> this <em>saintly Sinner</em> spied,<br />
And with malicious Pleasure ey&#8217;d,<br />
Well pleas&#8217;d to think that he had found<br />
Such a <em>Hell-Factor</em> above Ground;<br />
And thus began th&#8217; infernal Sprite&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;<em>Libidinoso!</em> if I&#8217;m right!<br />
Art thou that Son of mine on Earth,<br />
Whose deeds so loud proclaim thy Birth?<br />
Of whom so many Strumpets tell<br />
Such Tales as get Thee Fame in <em>Hell</em>?<br />
But Children know not whence they spring,<br />
Whether by Beggar got, or King;<br />
Yet I by <em>certain Marks</em> can know,<br />
Whether Thou art <em>my Child</em>, or no.<br />
Uncase&mdash;and let me see your Waist&mdash;<br />
For there are private Tokens plac&#8217;d,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
By which <em>my own</em> I know&mdash;if there<br />
No secret Lines of mine appear,<br />
I claim Thee not&mdash;but if I see<br />
The two <em>Initials</em> <em>F</em> and <em>P</em>,<br />
Then art Thou <em>mine</em>&mdash;nay, never start&mdash;<br />
And <em>Heav&#8217;n</em> can claim <em>in Thee</em> no Part&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
And now his sapless Trunk he stripp&#8217;d,<br />
Like Culprits sentenc&#8217;d to be whipp&#8217;d,<br />
When lo! th&#8217; <em>Initials</em> rose to View,<br />
And prov&#8217;d the Fiend&#8217;s Conjecture true.<br />
And all his Waist (detested Brand!)<br />
Was scribbled with the <em>Dev&#8217;l&#8217;s short Hand</em>;<br />
Was mark&#8217;d with <em>Whoredom</em>, <em>Lust</em>, and <em>Letchery</em>,<br />
<em>Malice</em>, <em>Hypocrisy</em>, and <em>Treachery</em>,<br />
With <em>Envy</em>, <em>Lying</em>, and <em>Betraying</em>,<br />
With <em>Fasting</em>, <em>Wenching</em>, <em>Fiddling</em>, <em>Praying</em>,<br />
And all the <em>Catalogue of Sin</em><br />
Deeply engraven in his Skin&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Pleas&#8217;d the <em>grim Pow&#8217;r</em> survey&#8217;d, and smil&#8217;d,<br />
Embrac&#8217;d and said&mdash;&ldquo;My darling Child,<br />
Blest was the Hour, and blest the Spot,<br />
Where Thou, <em>my &#8217;Bidin</em>, wert begot.<br />
Know then, you&#8217;re not what You profess,<br />
Her Son, whose Lands you do possess;<br />
No&mdash;Thou&#8217;rt <em>my wayward Son</em>, a Witch<br />
Litter&#8217;d thee in a loathsome Ditch;<br />
And (for all Creatures love the Young<br />
Which from their proper Loins are sprung)<br />
To this old Mansion thee convey&#8217;d,<br />
And in an Infant&#8217;s Cradle laid:<br />
And when the <em>Sorc&#8217;ress</em> plac&#8217;d thee there,<br />
She stole away the <em>native Heir</em>&mdash;<br />
Right well hast Thou, my Boy, repaid<br />
The <em>Obligations</em> on thee laid,<br />
And to thy Parents&#8217; Int&#8217;rest true<br />
Hast prov&#8217;d thy Fortunes were thy due&mdash;<br />
Go on&mdash;and, if thou canst, do more<br />
(But &#8217;t may not be) than heretofore&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Keep the same Path You always trod,<br />
And be an Enemy to <em>God</em>;<br />
Apply your Fortune to oppress,<br />
And harrass <em>Virtue</em> with Distress;<br />
To hide your Blemishes use Paint,<br />
To screen the <em>Villain</em> play the <em>Saint</em>;<br />
Affect <em>Religion</em>, <em>Church</em> frequent,<br />
Kneel, <em>seem</em> to pray, and keep up <em>Lent</em>&mdash;<br />
<em>Charity</em> too must be display&#8217;d,<br />
But <em>Charity in Masquerade</em>;<br />
Give <em>Alms</em>&mdash;but not to those that need,<br />
But only for the <em>Gallows feed</em>;<br />
Whene&#8217;er you meet a <em>preaching Thief</em>,<br />
Be prompt to reach him out Relief;<br />
If <em>Liars</em>, <em>Flatt&#8217;rers</em>, <em>Pandars</em>, <em>Pimps</em>,<br />
Or any of my vagrant Imps,<br />
Approach Thee, to thy Mansion take,<br />
And give them Welcome for my Sake;<br />
But <em>needy Merit</em> must not dare<br />
To hope with these <em>thy Alms</em> to share,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
Commit <em>that</em> to the <em>Bridewell</em>-lash,<br />
But give it neither <em>Food</em> nor <em>Cash</em>;<br />
Distinguish&#8217;d Honour shalt thou gain<br />
In <em>Pand&aelig;monium</em>, for thy Pain.<br />
But&mdash;one Word more&mdash;My Mind misgives,<br />
That <em>Virtue</em> a near <em>Neighbour</em> lives&mdash;<br />
For in my search to find out Thee,<br />
I spied in this Vicinity<br />
A Knot of Friends, where I cou&#8217;d trace<br />
<em>Honour</em> emblazon&#8217;d in their Face,<br />
These (for their Thoughts I plainly see)<br />
Bear no good Will to you or me;<br />
<em>Foolishly honest</em>, cheap they hold<br />
<em>Libidinoso</em> and his Gold,<br />
And will maintain, to Conscience true,<br />
Their Virtue, spite of Me and You.<br />
Altho&#8217; your Influence be weak,<br />
Oppose them for <em>opposing&#8217; Sake</em>,<br />
Do ev&#8217;ry little Act of Spite,<br />
And snarl, altho&#8217; You cannot bite&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Be faithful&mdash;there will come a Day,<br />
When I thy Services will pay,<br />
Will bring Thee to my Realm, and make<br />
Thee <em>Pilot of the burning Lake</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="poem">
He said&mdash;and quick as Thought withdrew,<br />
And to th&#8217; infernal Regions flew;<br />
Blue sulph&#8217;rous streaks the Peasants scare,<br />
Marking his passage thro&#8217; the Air&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
<em>Libidinoso</em> left behind,<br />
Began revolving in his Mind<br />
His Master&#8217;s Promises, and sigh&#8217;d<br />
To have them fully ratified;<br />
Then homeward plodded, (but, be sure,<br />
Before he went, he kiss&#8217;d his Whore)<br />
Resolv&#8217;d, if possible, on more<br />
And greater Evils than before.<br />
All vain was the Resolve&mdash;his Cup<br />
Of <em>Wickedness</em> was quite fill&#8217;d up,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
And no Cup can another drop<br />

Thou God of Truth and Love! excuse<br />

Warm in <em>thy Cause</em>, while She wou&#8217;d pray<br />
That Thou from <em>Earth</em> wou&#8217;d&#8217;st sweep away<br />

Who, mask&#8217;d with <em>spurious Piety</em>,<br />
Trample on <em>Reason</em>, <em>Truth</em>, and <em>Thee</em>,<br />
And, while their hot Career they run,<br />
Tread on the <em>Gospel</em> of thy Son!<br />
Who, feigning to adore, make Thee<br />
A <em>Tyrant-God</em> of Cruelty!<br />
As if thy <em>right Hand</em> did contain<br />
Only an Universe of Pain,<br />
<em>Hell</em> and <em>Damnation</em> in thy <em>Left</em>,<br />
Of ev&#8217;ry gracious Gift bereft,<br />
Hence raining Floods of Grief and Woes,<br />
On those that never were thy Foes,<br />
Ordaining Torments for the doom<br />
Of Infants, yet within the Womb:<br />

Who (tho&#8217; our <em>Saviour</em>&#8217;s gracious Plan<br />

By <em>friendly Arguments</em> to win<br />
The World from Slavery to Sin;<br />

So strictly faithful to their Trust,<br />

With saucy boldness will presume<br />

Of nought but endless Torments speak,<br />
To frighten and appall the weak;<br />
Dwell on the horrid Theme with glee,<br />
And fain themselves wou&#8217;d <em>Hangmen</em> be;<br />
With so much <em>Dread</em> their <em>Hearers</em> fill,<br />
That they have neither <em>Pow&#8217;r</em>, nor <em>Will</em>,<br />

A living Monument to be<br />
Of the <em>Almighty</em>&#8217;s Clemency!<br />
Who still is good, altho&#8217; You preach<br />

Can even spare a <em>Methodist</em>.</p>
